                    <p>Our Tyndale St-Georges Saturday Morning Music classes, led by Fran√ßoise Morin-Lyons, began in the fall of 2012, as an introduction to music for seven children.  It has grown to lessons to 23 children. Equally exciting are our musical activites for 2014 which emply all of the individual instruments that were to graciously given to us for the program - guitars, keyboards, violins, xylophone percussion sets. We also hope to add music teachers to the program.</p>

                    <p>Our Hymn Sing group has been active thanks to Dr. Jacqueline McClaran and a host of joyful singers, with visits to several seniors' residences and hospitals over the past year, sharing joy through music, and provided music for residents at Manoir Westment during two Ecumenical services led by the Rev. Veenstra. We're always pleased to welcome new singers - enthusiasm counts as much as talent.</p>
